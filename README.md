# prolog-examples

My solutions to the exercises of the book 'Learn Prolog Now!' by Patrick Blackburn, Johan Bos, and Kristina Striegnitz (http://learnprolognow.org/), to "P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems" (http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/) and some other assignments given in the "Artificial Intelligence 2" course by Sapienza University (spring 2016)
